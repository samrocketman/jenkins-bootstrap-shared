#Note: secret.key is purposefully not tracked by git. This should be backed up
#separately because configs may contain secrets which were encrypted using the
#secret.key.

#ignore all JENKINS_HOME except jobs directory, root xml config, and .gitignore file
/*
!/jobs
!/.gitignore
!/*.xml
!/@@MANIFEST@@
!/dailycommit.sh
!/@@PACKAGENAME@@-commit

#ignore all files in jobs subdirectories except for folders
#note: git doesn't track folders, only file content
jobs/**
!jobs/**/

#save next build numbers with config
!jobs/**/nextBuildNumber

#exclude only config.xml files in repository subdirectories
!config.xml

#as a result only settings and job config.xml files in JENKINS_HOME will be tracked by git
